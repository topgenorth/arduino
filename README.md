Arduino
=======

Just the various Arduino sketches I've been working with. Right now these are your basic "Hello World" kind of sketches.

Arduino IDE's are still pretty Spartan.  Going to try [VSCode plugin for Arduino](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino) and see how that works.

To monitor the serial port, I'm using [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/).  Seems to be "good enough" for what I want to do, and it's free. On Windows, I'd probably use something like puTTY.
